# CardGame
This game uses a standard 52-card deck and involves a dealer, two players, and a table with four places for players to place their cards. Each player has a private hand and a public bank where they keep the cards they win.

To start the game, the dealer shuffles and deals the cards to the players. The players take turns placing their cards on the table, and if a player's card matches the rank of another visible card on the table, they take both cards and add them to their bank, earning a point. If not, the card becomes the new top card in the current place. The game ends when both players run out of cards, and the winner is the one with the most pairs in their bank.

For ease of implementation, we use numbers to identify cards, with suits numbered 1 to 4 and ranks numbered 1 to 13. The game is implemented using an array and follows the rules outlined above.

We hope you enjoy playing my simple card game!
